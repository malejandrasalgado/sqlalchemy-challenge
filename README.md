# Sqlalchemy-Challenge

## Introduction 

The purpose of this challenge is to apply and complement the knowledge and skills acquired **Sqlalchemy-Challenge**

The task involves:
- GitHub
- SQLAlchemy ORM queries
- Pandas 
- Matplotlib
- Flask
- JSON
- Markdown 


### GitHub

On GitHub the following task where required 

1. `Create` a new repository called *sql-challenge*
2. `Push` all the changes 
3. Ensure that the repository has regular commitments and a through `README.md` file.

### SQLAlchemy ORM queries

#### Task using Jupyter Notebook 

1. Climate Analysis and Exploration 
    - Explore databases measurement and station become familiar with the given data. used the **inspector** to get the table names and info
2. Exploratory Precipitation Analysis and Exploratory Station Analysis
    - Start coding according with the instructions using **session.query**
    - Use Pandas Plotting with Matplotlib to plot the data 


### Climate App *Flask API*

1. Database Setup
2. Flask Setup
3. Create the routes
4. Create the sessions for each route and coding acording with the instructions 
   


### Bonus
Temperature Analysis I
Temperature Analysis II


For the bonus it was necessary to use the  trial and error to reach the solution 

#### Observations 

- The total number of stations are nine
- The most active station is USC00519281
- The average temperature for June is: 74.94째F
- The average temperature for December is: 71.04째F
- The paired T-Test is appropiate to measure June and December avaerage temperature. The T-Test shows a large statistic and a very small p value.Therefore, we conclude that June and December average temperatures are statistically different from one another.
- For the trip dates the minimum temperature is: 58.00째F and the maximum temperature is : 83.00째F


### Markdown

For the project I used basic syntax as **Headings**, **Bold**, **Lists**, **Links**, etc.
